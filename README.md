# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Updating to New Releases

Create React App  with JavaScript is divided into two packages:

- `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
- `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.

When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.

In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.

We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly.

## Sending Feedback

We are always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues).



For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.tsx` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

If you have Git installed and your project is not part of a larger repository, then a new repository will be initialized resulting in an additional `.git/` top-level directory.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
<br>
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers.<br>
Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).


### Supported Language Features

This project supports a superset of the latest javascript standard.<br>
In addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:

- [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).
- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).
- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018).
- [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)
- [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (part of stage 3 proposal).
- [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) syntax.

Learn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).

While we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.

Note that **this project includes no [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md)** by default.

If you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are [including the appropriate polyfills manually](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md), or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.
